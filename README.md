# Local Homology Clustering

This repo contains code for my master's dissertation on local homology and word embeddings at the University of Oxford.

The dissertation itself is [also in the repo](https://github.com/temcinas/applied_topology_project/blob/parallelisation/Temcinas_Dissertation.pdf).

The datasets are in the `Data` folder.
